# Roulette Strategies Simulation

This is the name of the project. It describes the whole project in one sentence, and helps people understand what the main goal and aim of the project is.

## Project description

Roulette Strategies Simulation allows you to quickly simulate roulette games with different strategies and varying input information.
Current available strategies are Martingale Strategy and Labouchere Strategy.
Project was build using:

- Typescript
- React
- MaterialUI
- Recharts

It allows not only to see the raw simulation result in the form of a table (and graph!), but it is also possible to observe the game "live", dynamically changing the speed of the simulation.
Project was created to improve my coding skills. It helped me to better understand state handling, context and managing input information.

Maybe later I could add possibility to create an account and save simulation history.

## How to Install and Run the Project

    1.  Clone repository
    2.  "npm install"
    3.  "npm run dev"
    4.  Open http://127.0.0.1:5173/

## How to Use the Project

Simply run simulation with default values or adjust input values to fit your needs
